- **CrowdSec** intrusion detection and prevention  
- **Certbot** automatic SSL certificates (Porkbun DNS-01)
- **Redis** for distributed rate limiting
- **Automated backups** and monitoring

See [DEPLOYMENT.md](DEPLOYMENT.md) for detailed instructions.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Simple Deployment

For development or simple hosting:

- **Vercel** (recommended): `npx vercel`
